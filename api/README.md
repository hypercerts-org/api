# HappyView API toolkit foundation

This package owns the shared API installer and build tooling, pinned upstream Lexicons, common view definitions, reusable Lua projections, and offline fixture/test utilities. The `modules/shared/manifest.json` contains record schemas and query Lexicons used as shared view types; it contains no Lua endpoint scripts. The `badge-queries` module installs five public badge query Lexicons and their Lua handlers. A foundation-only install therefore does not implement those queries.

For local development, checks, and HTTP runtime test requirements, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Install a released API bundle

Releases version the installable API bundle in this package; they do not publish to npm or deploy to a HappyView instance. This public repository's GitHub Releases and tagged source archives are the distribution channel. Choose an `@hypercerts-org/hypercerts-api@X.Y.Z` release tag, clone that snapshot, install its pinned workspace dependencies from the repository root, then run the installer from `api/`:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 --branch '@hypercerts-org/hypercerts-api@X.Y.Z' https://github.com/hypercerts-org/api.git hypercerts-api
cd hypercerts-api
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
cd api
HAPPYVIEW_BASE_URL='https://your-happyview.example' HAPPYVIEW_ADMIN_TOKEN='<scoped-admin-token>' pnpm install:api
```

Review that release's notes and target only an explicitly approved HappyView instance.

The reusable installer validates every local asset and dependency before making admin requests. `pnpm install:api` contacts a HappyView instance and uploads declared assets; do not run it without an explicitly approved target and token. It does not roll back writes if a later asset fails.


## Badge query endpoints

`modules/badge-queries/manifest.json` registers `searchBadgeDefinitions`, `getBadgeAward`, `listBadgeAwards`, `getBadgeResponse`, and `listBadgeResponses`. They read indexed PostgreSQL records and require no caller authentication. The shared module registers the badge definition, award, and response record schemas with backfill enabled; the query module does not add or migrate database tables.

Definition search trims the required `search` value and matches it as a case-insensitive literal substring in `title` or `description`; blank text is unrestricted. `authors` and `badgeTypes` are repeated query parameters with OR within each filter. Award-list filters combine with AND, while values in each array use OR. `subjects` accepts only DIDs or full record AT-URIs with valid collection NSIDs and matches only the corresponding DID or strong-reference URI variant; invalid entries reject the request. Badge-type filtering and embedded `badge` data use the exact definition URI and CID pinned by the award, while `badgeUris` compares only the URI.

Award views keep each award distinct and include `responseStatus` plus `recipientResponse`. The legitimate recipient is the subject DID or the DID in a record subject AT-URI. Only that repository's accepted or rejected response with the exact award URI and CID is eligible; unknown open response values remain visible in raw response queries but do not replace a prior eligible response. The latest eligible response is selected by index order and URI, not client `createdAt`. Missing exact definition versions remain visible as `badge: null`; absent eligible responses are `unanswered`. Raw response lookups and listings preserve history, include non-recipient records, and do not expand the referenced award. `listBadgeResponses` filters by award URI only.

All list endpoints use a default page size of 25, accept limits from 1 to 100, sort by `(createdAt, uri)` descending by default, and return an opaque cursor only when another page exists. Keep filters and sort direction unchanged when following a cursor. Repeated array parameters are limited to 100 supplied values; unknown parameters and repeated scalar parameters are rejected.
